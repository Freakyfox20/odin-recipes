    <h1>Air Fryer Chicken Quesadillas</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups shredded cooked chicken</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>8 (8 inch) flour tortillas</li>
      <li>2 cups grated cheese</li>
      <li>16 wooden toothpicks</li>
      <li>olive oil cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat an air fryer to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C), according to
        manufacturerâ€™s guidelines. Toss chicken with chili powder, cumin, and
        cayenne in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a tortilla on a work surface and cover half the tortilla with
        about 2 tablespoons grated cheese. Top with 2 tablespoons chicken
        mixture, then top with 2 additional tablespoons grated cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold tortilla in half and use wooden picks to hold the tortilla halves
        together. Spray both sides of the filled tortilla with olive oil spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Air fry quesadillas in a single layer until tortillas are lightly
        browned and cheese is melted, about 4 minutes per side. You may have to
        cook in batches. Serve warm with your favorite toppings.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cooking Note</h3>
    <p>
      Use cheese that melts easily, or a combination of cheeses, such as
      Monterey Jack, Cheddar, or Pepper-Jack. Queso asadero may also be used.
      For best results, buy bulk cheese and grate at home. Pre-grated cheese may
      have an anti-caking agent that may cause the cheese not to melt smoothly.
