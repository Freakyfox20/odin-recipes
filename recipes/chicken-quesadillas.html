      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat an air fryer to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C), according to
          manufacturerâ€™s guidelines. Toss chicken with chili powder, cumin, and
          cayenne in a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place a tortilla on a work surface and cover half the tortilla with
          about 2 tablespoons grated cheese. Top with 2 tablespoons chicken
          mixture, then top with 2 additional tablespoons grated cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fold tortilla in half and use wooden picks to hold the tortilla halves
          together. Spray both sides of the filled tortilla with olive oil
          spray.
        </li>
        <li>
          Air fry quesadillas in a single layer until tortillas are lightly
          browned and cheese is melted, about 4 minutes per side. You may have
          to cook in batches. Serve warm with your favorite toppings.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Cooking Note</h3>
      <p>
        Use cheese that melts easily, or a combination of cheeses, such as
        Monterey Jack, Cheddar, or Pepper-Jack. Queso asadero may also be used.
        For best results, buy bulk cheese and grate at home. Pre-grated cheese
        may have an anti-caking agent that may cause the cheese not to melt
        smoothly.
